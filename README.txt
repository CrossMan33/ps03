# Text Analysis with NLTK and WordCloud

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files for basic text analysis tasks using Python:

1. **NLTK**: A notebook demonstrating text processing and analysis with the `nltk` library, including tokenization, stemming, and more.
2. **WordCloud**: A notebook that generates customized word clouds based on text data, with options for color, shape, and other visualizations.

## Getting Started


Open the notebooks in colab and follow the instructions in each notebook to install any required libraries.

### Usage
- **NLTK.ipynb**: Run the cells sequentially to process and analyze text data with `nltk`.
- **WordCloud.ipynb**: Customize and visualize word clouds by running each cell, using a text file and an optional mask image.
